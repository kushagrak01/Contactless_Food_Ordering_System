# Contactless-Food-Ordering-System

Contactless Food Ordering is a project about developing a website which can be used to place an order in a restaurant without coming in contact or communicating with any restaurant staff. System like this is highly required during current Covid 19 pandemic where it is advisable to maintain social distance and reduce coming in contact with people as much as you can. 

There are two sides of this project, 1st is customer side from where customer can place, edit, review his order and can pay the bill to restaurant after completing meal. 2nd side is restaurant side from restaurantâ€™s staff can view order of all tables, mark any items delivered and generate bill for any table no. 

Open customer_h.html file to open customer side.

Open rest_open.html file to open restaurant side.

Enter table no as 1,2 or 3 in customer side.
